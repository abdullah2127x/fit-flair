# MongoDB Connection ETIMEOUT Issue

## Error Faced

While trying to connect to MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose in Node.js, the following errors were observed:

```
(node:21080) [MONGODB DRIVER] Warning: useNewUrlParser is a deprecated option
(node:21080) [MONGODB DRIVER] Warning: useUnifiedTopology is a deprecated option
Error saving document: MongooseError: Operation `messages.insertOne()` buffering timed out after 10000ms
MongoDB connection error: Error: queryTxt ETIMEOUT cluster0.kca96kr.mongodb.net
```

**Symptoms:**

* Mongoose was unable to connect to the Atlas cluster.
* Deprecation warnings appeared for `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology`.
* The connection timed out after 10 seconds.

---

## Cause

The `queryTxt ETIMEOUT` error typically occurs due to:

1. Network restrictions or firewall blocking outgoing connections to MongoDB Atlas (port 27017).
2. IPv6/Teredo tunneling being disabled on Windows, causing DNS TXT record lookups to fail.
3. Deprecated Mongoose options (`useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology`) in newer versions (7+).

Even though the IP whitelist was set to `0.0.0.0/0` in Atlas, the connection still timed out because Teredo (used for IPv6 tunneling) was disabled.

## Solution

### Step 1: Enable Teredo via Command Prompt

1. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**.
2. Run the following command to enable Teredo:

```cmd
netsh interface teredo set state type=enterpriseclient
```

3. Check the status:

```cmd
netsh interface teredo show state
```

Expected output:

```
Type                    : enterpriseclient
Server Name             : win1910.ipv6.microsoft.com.
State                   : dormant (will become qualified on first connection)
```

> Dormant state is normal; it will switch to `qualified` when used.

### Step 2: Ensure Node.js is Allowed Through Firewall

1. Press **Windows + R**, type `control firewall.cpl`, and press Enter.
2. Click **"Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"**.
3. Ensure **Node.js** is checked for **Private** and **Public** networks.
4. Apply changes.

### Step 3: Use Mongoose 7+ Correctly

Remove deprecated options from the connection string:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('YOUR_MONGODB_URI_HERE')
  .then(() => console.log('MongoDB connected successfully'))
  .catch(err => console.error('MongoDB connection error:', err));
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_MONGODB_URI_HERE` with the full connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

### Step 4: Optional GUI Method to Enable Teredo

1. Press **Windows + R**, type `services.msc`, press Enter.
2. Find **IP Helper**, right-click â†’ **Properties**.
3. Set **Startup type** to **Automatic** and click **Start**.
4. Press **Windows + R**, type `ncpa.cpl`, open your active network adapter properties.
5. Ensure **IPv6 (TCP/IPv6)** is checked.

## Result

After enabling Teredo and allowing Node.js through the firewall, running the Mongoose script should successfully connect to MongoDB Atlas without the ETIMEO

use the second instead of the first to resolve the error i.e 

Clerk: auth() was called but Clerk can't detect usage of clerkMiddleware(). Please ensure the following: - Your Middleware exists at ./src/middleware.(ts|js) - clerkMiddleware() is used in your Next.js Middleware. - Your Middleware matcher is configured to match this route or page. - If you are using the src directory, make sure the Middleware file is inside of it.
